# BigRedHacks

A game by Kevin Li, Justin Tran, and Edwin Ma

All game logic, backgrounds, character models, and art designs were created from scratch in less that 24 hours.

To run this game, make sure you have the PyGame library installed.

Then, download and unzip it with 7zip (or whichever program you choose).

Go to the command prompt and type "cd [path to the unzipped folder]" without quotation marks

Then type "python game.py" (again without quotations).

Arrow keys are used to move, and space bar to shoot. Enjoy!
